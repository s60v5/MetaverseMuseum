### Contept 

* Allow users to travel into a virtual world using the VR technology and enable them to explore Taiwanese calligraphy as they were on an art exhibition.
* Both paintings introduced in the project are made by two Taiwanese calligraphy artists - 黃金凌 (Huang Jin-Ling) and 徐永進 (Xu Yong-Jin).
* Huang Jin-Ling & Xu Yong-Jin’s calligraphy can be classified as 現代書藝 (modern calligraphy) - not to be confused with 書法, as their work breaks with the traditional calligraphy rules in terms of the aesthetics and meaning. 

### Case Studies & References

In terms of the design of the exhibition area I think it’s best to keep it simple and focus more on the problem on how to enable users to experience the selected works through VR in the more immersive way. In order to do so, we will have to focus on the story behind the selected works and use the technology VR to tell the stories in more performative ways. 

### Selected work #1

![Work 1](https://github.com/s60v5/MetaverseMuseum/blob/master/Assets/Work 1.jpeg?raw=true)

**Huang Jin-Ling - 之乎者也 (zhī hū zhě yě)**

之乎者也 is an idiom in Chinese, all four charachters in this idiom are also the most used characters in the Chinese ancient literature. In this work, Huang Jin-Ling is trying to criticize artists and literates for being too pedantic about using too many archaisms, which eventually makes their articles or poems hard to understand. On another hand, the idiom 之乎者也 also means “a language that is too complicated or chaotic”. All of this makes this work a little contradicting given the fact that Huang Jin-Ling wrote quite a long text in the bottom left explaining the meaning behind this work (he was probably afraid of people not getting his intention). 

### Selected work #2

**Xu Yong-Jin - “TAIWAN”**

6 letters, if we put all of them together we can see a typical sightseeing situation from the Yeliu Park in Xinbei, Taiwan:

T - Shape of a rock from the Yeliu Park in Xinbei\
A - A tour guide holding a piece of paper and introducing the rock\
I - A toursit listening / talking to the tour guide\
W - Two happy people (probably a couple) holding their hands\
A & N - I think both represent grandmas hugging children

### TODO

There are some old scripts like *Example* or *WallCollision* that we wrote during our classes, these scripts can be removed in future as they are no longer needed.
